# Crystal localization with unsupervised deep reinforce learning


The exfoliation technique of two-dimensional quantum materials has opened up a plethora of fields of research in condensed matter physics. Despite the breakthroughs, device fabrication of such exfoliable quantum materials still remains very inefficient. One aspect of such inefficiency comes from the need to manually search and crop images of candidates from hundreds of exfoliated crystals. The proposed algorithm searches and actively localizes exfoliated crystals using a combination of unsupervised learning and deep reinforcement learning, thereby significantly reducing the effort spent on device fabrication procedures of two-dimensional materials.
